6. **Commit:** `Fix config.yml formatting`

---

## **WHAT CAUSED THE ERROR**

The `|` pipe characters inside the description string broke the YAML formatting. YAML uses `|` as a special character for multi-line strings. When Jekyll tried to read the file it got confused at that point and stopped building.

The fix removes the pipe characters and keeps the description as a simple clean string on one line.

## **WHAT CHANGED**

The description now reads:
