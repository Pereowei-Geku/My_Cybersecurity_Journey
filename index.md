# Welcome to My Cybersecurity Portfolio

> **"Security is not a destination, but a continuous journey of learning and adaptation."**

Welcome! I am a cybersecurity enthusiast dedicated to exploring the vast landscape of digital defence. My approach is driven by a deep curiosity about how systems break and a commitment to learning how to fix them. 

While my current projects touch on **Cloud Security** and **Threat Intel**, I view these as building blocks. I am actively expanding my knowledge across the entire "Cyber Stack"—from network defence and ethical hacking to GRC and incident response. This portfolio serves as a living document of my growth, labs, and the technical challenges I tackle along the way.
